# FUST Novamatic CL 1590 for ESPHome

This project integrates a Novamatic CL 1590 portable mini-split
air conditioning unit, through its infrared port and a small
ESP8285 microcontroller with infrared transmitter on board
(typically board type `esp01_m` on ESPHome).  It supports all
modes and temperature targets of the air conditioner unit.
