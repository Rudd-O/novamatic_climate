# FUST Novamatic CL 1590 for ESPHome

This project integrates a Novamatic CL 1590 portable mini-split
air conditioning unit, through its infrared port and a small
ESP8285 microcontroller with infrared transmitter on board
(typically board type `esp01_m` on ESPHome).  It supports all
modes and temperature targets of the air conditioner unit.

The remote control this climate component simulates is model
number AR-715 (parts code IR30-0168CN---B), so check your
A/C unit's remote â€” if it matches, this is for you: you got
yourself a smart A/C unit now.
