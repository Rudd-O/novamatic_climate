# FUST Novamatic CL 1590 for ESPHome

This project integrates a Novamatic CL 1590 portable mini-split
air conditioning unit, through its infrared port and a small
ESP8285 microcontroller with infrared transmitter on board
(typically board type `esp01_m` on ESPHome).  It supports all
modes and temperature targets of the air conditioner unit.

## Will this work with my A/C unit?

The remote control this climate component simulates is model
number AR-715 (parts code IR30-0168CN---B), so check your
A/C unit's remote â€” if it matches, this is for you: you got
yourself a smart A/C unit now.

## Will this work with my ESP device?

Probably, so long as it has an infrared transmitter that can
do 38 KHz.
[This is the unit I got](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005001598129325.html).
It works perfectly with the code as it ships.

If your transmitter doesn't do 38 KHz by default, you may have
to adjust the code to change the default frequency of your unit,
as the code does not do this currently.  Right after
`auto *data = transmit.get_data();` in `novamatic_climate.cpp`
you may add `data->set_carrier_frequency(38000);` to achieve
that effect.

## How do I program the circuit?

Use your own version of this sample ESPHome sketch:

```yaml

wholly ignored and overridden by the code.
